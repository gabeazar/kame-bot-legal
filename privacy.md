Last Updated: October 22, 2025

We respect your privacy. This policy covers data collection/usage:

1. **Collected Data**: Discord user IDs (for linking/roles), FACEIT GUIDs/Steam IDs (for stats/matches), IP (logs only, anonymized). No personal info beyond IDs.
2. **Purpose**: Enable features (e.g., Elo roles, voice moves). Retained as needed; deleted on unlink.
3. **Storage/Security**: Encrypted VPS (SQLite DB), rate-limited APIs. No cookies/tracking.
4. **Sharing**: Never sold/shared. Only with Discord/FACEIT/Steam for auth.
5. **Rights**: EU/CA users: GDPR/CPRA compliant—request deletion via DM to bot owner.

Changes: We'll notify via server announcements.
